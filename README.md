# Basic-PIC18-Embedded-C-Programs
These are some of the various excercises that I am working on to learn Embedded C using PIC18 Microcontroller.

LAB1 includes the following programs:

Excercise1: This program outputs FFH to 00H in the form of binary at PORTB of PIC18.

exc2: This program outputs the hex codes of various ASCII characters already stored in the RAM at PORTB of the microcontroller.

exc3: This program outputs the hex codes of integers -6 to +6, which are already stored in the RAM at PORTB of the microcontroller.

exc4: This program toggles the output at PORTB 20,000 times.

exc5: This program toggles the output at PORTB 20,000 times with a delay 500 ms after every toggle.


LAB2 includes the following programs:

Excercise1: This program toggles the output at pin 0 of PORTB with a delay generated using Timer0 of PIC18.

exc5: This program helps to toggle the output at pin RB0 if the onboard switch of PIC-P40 is in OFF position and othervise toggle the output at pin RB4 of PIC18 and also the delay used to create waves of different frequencies is generated using Timer.
