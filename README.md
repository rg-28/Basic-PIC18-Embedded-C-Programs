# Basic-PIC18-Embedded-C-Programs
These are some of the various excercises that I am working on to learn Embedded C using PIC18 Microcontroller.

LAB1 includes the following programs:
Excercise1: This program outputs FFH to 00H in the form of binary at PORTB of PIC18.
exc2: This program outputs the hex codes of various ASCII characters already stored in the RAM at PORTB of the microcontroller.
exc3: This program outputs the hex codes of integers -6 to +6, which are already stored in the RAM at PORTB of the microcontroller.
exc4: This program toggles the output at PORTB 20,000 times.
exc5: This program toggles the output at PORTB 20,000 times with a delay 500 ms after evry toggle.
